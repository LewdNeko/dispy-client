# dispy-client
A barebones Python Discord client, for bots!

[My Discord Server](https://discordapp.com/invite/uV5y7RY)

At the moment this is a prototype, it will be buggy. I will be working on this alot for the next week or so, and I hope to make it actually start looking like a real client.

NOTE: Requires discord.py rewrite
